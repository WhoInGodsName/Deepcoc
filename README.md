# Deepcoc AKA Nemesis
Nemesis is the first mod I have made.  It is for the game Deep Rock Galactic and coded in C#.  This project was used for experimenting with accessing, reading, and writing to in game memory externally, signature scanning, detour creation and more.  The code is messy due to much experimentation but provided a lot of insight for future projects!
